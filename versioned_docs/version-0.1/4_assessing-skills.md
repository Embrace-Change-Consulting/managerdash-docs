This guide covers how to evaluate and track skills and competencies in ManagerDash.

## Understanding Skills Assessment

Skills assessment helps you evaluate team members across multiple competencies, track skill development over time, and identify areas for growth.

### Key Concepts

- **Assessment**: A complete skills evaluation for one person
- **Competency**: A specific skill or capability being evaluated
- **Category**: Grouping of related competencies (e.g., Technical, Team Contribution)
- **Rating**: Numeric score from 0-4 for each competency

## Creating a Skills Assessment

### First-Time Setup

When you first visit the Skills tab for a person:

1. Select the person from the sidebar
2. Click the **Skills** tab
3. If no assessment exists, you'll see an empty state
4. Click **"Create Skills Assessment"**
5. The assessment is created with all configured competencies

**Note**: Competencies are defined globally and must be set up in Settings → Manage Teams before creating assessments.

## Rating Scale

Each competency uses a 0-4 rating scale:

| Rating | Label | Meaning | Color |
|--------|-------|---------|-------|
| 0 | Not a focus | Not a development priority | Gray |
| 1 | Needs focus | Development priority | Orange |
| 2 | On track | Meets expectations | Blue |
| 3 | Outperform | Exceeds expectations | Green |
| 4 | Exceptional | Significantly exceeds expectations | Purple |

## Evaluating Competencies

## Best Practices

### Assessment Timing

1. **Initial Baseline**: Create within first month
2. **Regular Updates**: Review every 3-6 months
3. **Pre-Review**: Update before performance reviews
4. **Post-Projects**: Reassess after major projects

### Rating Guidelines

1. **Be Consistent**: Use the same criteria for everyone
2. **Use Full Scale**: Don't cluster around 2-3
3. **Evidence-Based**: Rate based on observed work
4. **Growth Mindset**: Focus on development, not judgment
5. **Seniority Context**: Consider role expectations

### Note-Taking

1. **Specific Examples**: "Led architecture review for X project"
2. **Observable Behaviors**: Not personality traits
3. **Recent Evidence**: Focus on last 3-6 months
4. **Balanced**: Include strengths and growth areas
5. **Actionable**: Link to development goals

### Discussion Preparation

Use skills assessment in 1-on-1s:

1. **Review Together**: Share screen, walk through competencies
2. **Self-Assessment**: Have them rate themselves first
3. **Compare Views**: Discuss rating differences
4. **Growth Plans**: Link low ratings to development goals
5. **Celebrate Strengths**: Acknowledge high ratings

## Integration with Goals

Link skills to goals for development:

1. Identify competencies rated 0-1 (needs focus)
2. Create goals to improve these areas
3. Add milestones with skill-building activities
4. Reference competency in goal description
5. Reassess after goal completion

## Reporting

Skills data appears in reports:

### Individual Reports
- Current ratings for all competencies
- Notes for each competency
- Last assessment date
- Average rating

### Exported Reports
- Full competency breakdown
- Ratings with labels
- Notes included

## Common Workflows

### Onboarding Assessment

```
Week 1: Create baseline assessment
Week 2-4: Observe work, gather evidence
Month 1: Complete initial ratings
Month 1: Discuss in 1-on-1
Month 1: Create development goals based on gaps
```

### Quarterly Review

```
Week before review: Update all ratings
Week before review: Add fresh notes
During review: Review radar chart together
During review: Discuss changes from last quarter
During review: Set goals for next quarter
```

### Performance Review Prep

```

During review: Use radar chart as visual aid
After review: Update goals based on discussion
```

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Quick Updates**: Focus on competencies that changed since last review
2. **Use Notes Field**: Document examples as they happen, not just during reviews
3. **Screenshot Charts**: Save radar charts to track visual progress over time
4. **Category Focus**: Review one category at a time for thoroughness
5. **Compare to Goals**: Check if skills align with goal progress
6. **Seniority Levels**: Consider role level when interpreting ratings
7. **Team Calibration**: Discuss ratings with other managers for consistency
8. **Auto-Save**: Don't worry about saving; ratings and notes save automatically
